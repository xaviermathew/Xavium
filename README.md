# Xavium
 A cost-aware planner that supports parallel execution.

 Input a sequence of steps (what function to execute, what args to pass, parallelizable or not) and a way to calculate costs for each step, and Xavium will execute them in the most optimal way.

 This project is meant to be a reusable framework on which to build systems like Spark, Solr, Postgres, etc. Very much a work-in-progress at the moment.
